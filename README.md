# Usage

You can add a digging designation to the end of any of the drawing commands - [dujihrx].  The default is 'd'.

For example, `digshape star 5 2 j` will dig a 5 pointed star out of downstairs with the mark as the center and the cursor as a vertex on the star

## In-game help
    digshape ?

## Set the origin
    digshape origin

## Draw a line
    digshape line
*from cursor to mark*

## Draw an ellipse
    digshape ellipse
*cursor and mark as bounding box*

## Draw a polygon with cursor as vertex
    digshape polygon <n sides>
*mark as center and cursor as a vertex*

## Draw a polygon with cursor as apothem
    digshape polygon <n sides> apothem
*mark as center and cursor as a midpoint*

## Draw a star polygon
In [Schl√§fli symbol notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol)
*mark as center and cursor as a vertex*

    digshape star <n sides> [skip=2]


## Draw an Archimedean spiral with specified number of "coils", each point separated by "chord" tiles
    digshape spiral <coils> <chord>
