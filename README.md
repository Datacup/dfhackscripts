# Some DFHack scripts

Some dfhack scripts from friends of keupo on twitch
# Usage
*note*: any of the drawing commands can be appended with a digging designation [dujihrx] at the end, or will default to 'd'

for example, `digshape star 5 2 j` will dig a 5 pointed star out of downstairs with the mark as the center and the cursor as a vertex on the star

## in-game help
`digshape ?`

## set mark
	digshape origin

## draw a line
	digshape line
*from cursor to mark*

## draw an ellipse
	digshape ellipse [filled]
*cursor and mark as bounding box*

## draw an ellipse by axis
        digshape major
*set the major axis from origin to mark, must be horizontal or vertical*

        digshape ellipse3p [filled]
*draw ellipse using marked major axis and current point as the minor axis radius*

## draw a circle
        digshape circle2p [filled]
*draw a circle using origin and mark as a diameter*

## draw a polygon with cursor as vertex
	digshape polygon <n sides>
*mark as center and cursor as a vertex*

## draw a polygon with cursor as apothem
	digshape polygon <n sides> apothem
*mark as center and cursor as a midpoint*

## draw a star polygon
	digshape star <n sides> [skip=2]
in [Schl√§fli symbol notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol)
*mark as center and cursor as a vertex*
