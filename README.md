# Some DFHack scripts

Some dfhack scripts from friends of keupo on twitch
# Usage
*note*: any of the drawing commands can be appended with a digging designation [dujihrx] at the end, or will default to 'd'

for example, `digshape star 5 2 j` will dig a 5 pointed star out of downstairs with the mark as the center and the cursor as a vertex on the star

## in-game help
`digshape ?`

## set mark
	digshape origin

## draw a line
	digshape line
*from cursor to mark*

## draw an ellipse
	digshape ellipse [filled]
*mark and cursor as bounding box*

### draw an ellipse using 3 pt
	digshape major  
*set the end of the major axis from mark to cursor*

	digshape ellipse3p
*draw the ellipse using new cursor as the semiminor axis length (midpoint of major axis->cursor)*  
*Note: ellipse3p cannot yet be filled by an argument, use flood*

## draw a circle with arbitrary diameter
	digshape circle2p
*mark and cursor form the diameter of the circle (at any tilt)*

## draw a 3 pt bezier curve
	digshape major
*set the endpoint of the curve*

	digshape bez [sharpness=1.5]
*draw the curve between mark and endpoint, pulled towards the cursor. A weight may be specified to adjust the sharpness of the curve [0=straight line, large number=hairpin).*

## draw a polygon with cursor as vertex
	digshape polygon <n sides>
*mark as center and cursor as a vertex*

## draw a polygon with cursor as apothem
	digshape polygon <n sides> apothem
*mark as center and cursor as a midpoint*

## draw a star polygon
	digshape star <n sides> [skip=2]
in [Schl√§fli symbol notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol)
*mark as center and cursor as a vertex*

## flood fill an area
        digshape flood [max coverage=10000]
*Fill an area with a dig designation. Will only fill tiles that match the designation under the cursor.*  
*Note: Larger max coverages can take time to fill. A great way to fill in the above shapes.*

## undo last digshape command
        digshape undo
*restores designations for the last digshape command. Will not record manual or other commands designations, but won't loose it's record.*
